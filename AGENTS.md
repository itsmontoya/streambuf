# AGENTS.md

This document defines the boundaries and expectations for AI agents operating in this repository.

Human contributors own all production code and logic.
AI assistance is restricted in scope as defined below.

# Core Rule

AI agents must not modify, generate, refactor, or rewrite production code or business logic in this repository.

This includes:

* Function implementations
* Control flow
* Struct definitions
* Interface definitions
* Concurrency logic
* Architectural decisions
* Dependency wiring

All logic is human-authored and human-reviewed.

# Allowed Scope for AI Assistance

AI agents may assist with:

* Code comments
* GoDoc documentation
* README updates
* Markdown documentation
* Test scaffolding
* Table-driven test case generation
* Expanding test coverage (without altering logic)
* Improving clarity of documentation

AI may suggest improvements, but must not directly change implementation logic.

# Style Enforcement

When assisting with comments, documentation, or tests, AI agents must follow STYLEGUIDE.md.

This includes:

* File-per-type structure
* Constructor placement rules
* Named returns (no naked returns)
* Early return patterns
* Grouped var declarations
* No shadowing

AI must not introduce stylistic drift.

# Tests and AI

AI may generate tests that validate existing behavior.

AI must not:

* Modify function signatures
* Change return types
* Introduce new behavior into production code

Tests generated by AI must:

* Be readable
* Follow table-driven patterns when appropriate
* Remain explicit and non-clever
* Avoid unnecessary abstractions

# Documentation Expectations

AI may:

* Improve clarity of comments
* Expand GoDoc descriptions
* Add architectural explanations
* Clarify intent and rationale

AI must not rewrite logic under the guise of documentation updates.

# Change Discipline

If an AI agent believes logic should change:

* It may suggest the change in a comment or documentation note.
* It must not implement the change.

Human maintainers retain full control over all behavioral changes.

# Guiding Philosophy

This repository prioritizes intentional design and explicit authorship.

AI is a support tool for clarity and testing — not a source of implementation logic.

When in doubt, do less.
Preserve human intent.
Defer behavioral decisions to maintainers.
